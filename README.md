# Getting Started with React + TypeScript, eslint, and prettier

This is a simple boiler plate made with create-react-app.
It includes, TypeScript, eslint, and prettier.

The linting script will:
a.) run eslint rules
b.) run prettier and reformat the code based on the eslint rules.

In the terminal, simply run:

## `npm run lint`

The boilerplate also has the vscode configurations to run eslint and prettier on saving changes to files.
In case this feature isn't working, you may need to check that the vscode configutions are set.
