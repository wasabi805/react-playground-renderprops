# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a simple boiler plate made with create-react-app.
It includes, TypeScript, eslint, and prettier.

The linting script will:
a.) run eslint rules
b.) run prettier and reformat the code based on the eslint rules.

In the terminal, simply run:

## `npm run lint`
